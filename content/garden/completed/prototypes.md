# Prototype-based Interpretability for Legal Citation Prediction

[Github](https://github.com/chufeiluo/prototype-lcp)

## Project Description
Deep learning has made significant progress in the past decade, and demonstrates potential to solve problems with extensive social impact. In high-stakes decision making areas such as law, experts often require interpretability for automatic systems to be utilized in practical settings. 

In this work, we attempt to address these requirements applied to the important problem of legal citation prediction (LCP). We design the task with parallels to the thought-process of lawyers, i.e., with reference to both precedents and legislative provisions. After initial experimental results, we refine the target citation predictions with the feedback of legal experts. Additionally, we introduce a prototype architecture to add interpretability, achieving strong performance while adhering to decision parameters used by lawyers. 

Our study builds on and leverages the state-of-the-art language processing models for law, while addressing vital considerations for high-stakes tasks with practical societal impact.

## Significance
This project studied:
- How to further fine-tune a pre-trained model to become more interpretable
- How to design tasks and evaluations catered to legal experts
- Tradeoffs between interpretability and abstraction

## Post mortem
I like this paper, still. This was my first paper accepted to a top venue, and I did all of the methodology myself.

I think hindsight is 20-20 - many people complain that reviews are harsh now, but they were honestly just as harsh in 2022, if not harsher. I won't complain about them too much here, but let's just say peer review has never been kind to me. It also feels like another world, honestly. I don't know if the ideas we presented in this paper would be accepted now. It's gotten better recently, but I think that's an aspect of research that burns me out quickly - the feeling that my body of work is no longer interesting to anyone, and the feeling that I need to chase the crowd to be taken seriously.
