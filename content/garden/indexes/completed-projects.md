# Completed Projects
Here you can find the repositories and papers for projects I would consider complete-ish. Some pages have post-mortem reflections - what I could have done better, what is left to be explored, etc.

## Interpretability
[[prototypes]] - Making citation prediction more easily understood by lawyers with prototype theory, precedents, and legislation
## Datasets
[[legalhatespeech]] - Grounding the subjectivity of hate speech in 11 definitions from various legal authorities

[[misinformation]] - Grounding the assessment of misinformation in possible legal implications
## Bias
[[biaskg]] - Building a dynamic knowledge graph from natural language for assessing social bias in LLMs

## Test-time Alignment
[[sae-pd]] - Investigating model steering with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for pluralistic alignment on sparse legal data
